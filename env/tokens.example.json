// this app needs 2 keys:
// 1. For user authentiction - only needs the 'public' scope
// 2. For syncing the database - can have more permissions for faster syncing

// This is because syncing the database might reach the request quota while syncing the database
// and when users try to login they can't because there is a oauth request to validate their login

{
	"userAuth": {
		"UID": "",

		"UID": "",
		"secret": "",
		"maxRequestPerSecond": 2 // rate limiter, you can find this number on in the line "Your application has a secondly rate limit set at " on the application page
